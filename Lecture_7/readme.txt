Lecture 7

7.1 Generate a histogram of type II burst in 2010, see how a specific column is addressed in line 26
      load and run HistoCMDspeed/CMDhistogram.py
      load and run HistoCMDspeed/CMDfull_histogram.py the same for years 2010-2019
      you may try another type of burst or another column of the data file

7.2 plot a 2D-image and by left muse clicking folow the ridge of this type II burst
      end with right mouse click
      load and run InteractivePixel/interactive4.py
      for homework: try to save x- and y-coordinate in an ASCII-file.

7.3 click allong the type II as smooth as you can (left mouse). When finished right mouse click and see
      the data which you can get out of a type II. See how parameter are defined in lines 22-30.
      load and run InteractiveCME/Multi_FIT_Newkirk.py
      click very carefully along the ridge of the burst. Not too close and not to distant.
      Ideally click with a distance from one pixel to the next of about 5mm

7.4 See, how two y-axis can be plotted and overelay of completely different physical properties
      of a solar event.
7.4.1 load and run PlotManyFITSandGOESsingleImageDualYaxis/PlotManyFITSandGOESsingleImageDualYaxis.py
         This shows the standard background
7.4.1 load and run PlotManyFITSandGOESsingleImageDualYaxis/PlotManyFITSandGOESsingleImageDualYaxis_b.py
         while this version makes a black background
